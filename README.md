## Project Overview:
This project employs NetLogo to simulate diverse COVID-19 scenarios, allowing for the adjustment of critical factors like population size, infection rate, vaccination rate, mask usage rate, mask-reduced infection rate, recovery rate, hospital capacity affecting recovery rate, and death rate. The simulation aims to evaluate the effects of these factors on disease spread and fatality, providing a comprehensive analysis of the pandemic dynamics
