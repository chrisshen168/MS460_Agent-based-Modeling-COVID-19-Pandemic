## Project Overview:
This project employs NetLogo to simulate diverse COVID-19 scenarios, allowing for the adjustment of critical factors like population size, infection rate, vaccination rate, mask usage rate, mask-reduced infection rate, recovery rate, hospital capacity affecting recovery rate, and death rate. The simulation aims to evaluate the effects of these factors on disease spread and fatality, providing a comprehensive analysis of the pandemic dynamics

## Findings and recommendations
This research employs Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) through NetLogo to assess vaccination, mask-wearing, and healthcare capacity's impact on pandemic dynamics. Findings indicate that increased vaccination rates, mask usage, and improved hospital capacity effectively mitigate disease spread and reduce fatalities. The recommendation is to advocate for these measures not only in the context of COVID-19 but also for combating other infectious diseases. Supporting agent-based modeling studies in healthcare is also advised for enhanced preparedness and response strategies.
## Color setup
The turtles was originally set up using 4 colors: vaccinated and recovered set to blue (both being immune), masked healthy set to green, unmasked healthy set to violet, infected set to red, and dead set to gray.
More colors could be used to distinguish turtles at a different status, e.g. vaccinated changed to pink, and masked healthy changed to orange (example6). 
## Intervention effects on incidence and_or fatality rate.html
Vaccination rate = 0.25 on incidence rate and/or fatality rate / Masked vs unmasked on incidence rate and/or fatality rate
(example.png)     
Vaccination rate = 0.50 on incidence rate and/or fatality rate / Masked vs unmasked on incidence rate and/or fatality rate
(example2.png)     
Vaccination rate = 0.80 on incidence rate and/or fatality rate / Masked vs unmasked on incidence rate and/or fatality rate
(example3.png)     
Hospital capacity = 100, recovery-rate = 0.10 on incidence rate and/or fatality rate
(example4_1.png, and example4.png)     
Hospital capacity = 200, recovery-rate = 0.15 on incidence rate and/or fatality rate
